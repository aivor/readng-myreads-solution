# MyReads Project

This is My Solution to the Udacity React Nanodegree course first project "MyReads App". I created the project by forking and cloning the starter files provided by Udacity. I then followed the project rubric and implemented the app logic.  

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
